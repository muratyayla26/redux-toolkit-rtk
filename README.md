# React Redux Toolkit

I created this repo in parallel with [Dave Gray React Redux Toolkit tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3KlatzB7GM&list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6M1J5I1w2-uZx36Qp6qhjKo) to comprehend concept and basic working principles of Redux Toolkit, see the differences between the standard way to write Redux logic and use as a playground when i need.

Repo includes information about; configuring store, slices, async thunk, entity adapter, rtk query etc.

The codes in this repo may differ from the tutorial in some parts.

As the methods used were changed, the old methods were commented out.

To run application locally:
+ Clone the repo and run `npm install`
+ Install [JSON server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) and run `json-server --watch ./data/db.json --port 3500` and then `npm start`
